## Demo 1: First-Time User Experience (Greeting Flow)

### Platform: Any (iOS/Android consistent)

```
👤 User: hi

🤖 Bot: [Sends ❤️ reaction]
🤖 Bot: [Shows interactive buttons]
       ┌─────────────────────────┐
       │   Professional          │
       ├─────────────────────────┤
       │   Casual                │
       └─────────────────────────┘

👤 User: [Clicks "Professional"]

🤖 Bot: Got it — I'll reply in a Professional tone. How can I help today?

👤 User: My manager keeps changing project priorities and I'm feeling overwhelmed.

🤖 Bot: What feels hardest for you — the constant changes, or how you're reacting to them?

👤 User: It's really about the constant changes.

🤖 Bot: Let's use a framework that can help you with flexibility in situations like this. 
       First, let's Spot the specific challenge — can you describe one recent priority 
       shift that was particularly difficult?

👤 User: Yesterday my boss asked me to drop everything and work on a client presentation 
       due tomorrow. I had already planned my week.

🤖 Bot: That's frustrating when your plan gets disrupted. Now Think — what's within your 
       control here? The changes themselves, or how you respond to them?

👤 User: I guess how I respond.

🤖 Bot: Exactly. So one small Engage step you could try: block 30 minutes each morning 
       to review priorities with your manager before diving in. Would that help reduce 
       surprises?

👤 User: That could work. I'll try it.

🤖 Bot: Great. After trying it for a week, Perform a quick check-in: Did it reduce last-
       minute chaos? What worked, what didn't?
```

**Key Features Shown:**
- ❤️ Greeting reaction
- Tone selection (Professional)
- STEP framework in action
- Short, natural responses (1-2 sentences)
- Practical, actionable advice

## Demo 2: Emotional Intelligence Scenario (4Rs Framework)

```
👤 User: I feel ignored when my teammate doesn't listen to my ideas in meetings.

🤖 Bot: What feels more challenging here — adjusting to their style, or how you feel 
       in that moment?

👤 User: It's definitely how I feel. It's really frustrating.

🤖 Bot: Let's use a framework for managing emotions in these situations. You've already 
       started Recognize — you know it triggers frustration. What physical signs do you 
       notice when this happens?

👤 User: My chest gets tight and I stop talking.

🤖 Bot: That's helpful awareness. For Regulate — when you notice that tightness, what 
       could help you stay calm? Take a breath? Remind yourself something?

👤 User: Maybe remind myself that my ideas are still valuable even if they're not heard 
       right away.

🤖 Bot: That's solid. Now Respect — why might your teammate not be listening? Not 
       personal to you, or something else?

👤 User: They're probably stressed with their own deadlines.

🤖 Bot: Likely. Last step, Reflect — what's one small boundary you could test? Like 
       saying "I'd like to finish my point" when interrupted?

👤 User: I could try that.

🤖 Bot: You've used the full 4Rs approach. Use it anytime you're managing difficult 
       work situations.
```

**Key Features Shown:**
- 4Rs framework (Recognize → Regulate → Respect → Reflect)
- Emotional intelligence coaching
- Empathetic but brief responses
- Self-awareness building
- Practical coping strategies

## Demo 3: Casual Tone (Gen Z Style)

```
👤 User: hello

🤖 Bot: [Sends ❤️ reaction]
🤖 Bot: [Shows tone buttons]

👤 User: [Clicks "Casual"]

🤖 Bot: Cool — I'll keep it casual. What's up?

👤 User: my boss keeps giving me work right when i'm about to leave

🤖 Bot: That's super frustrating. Does this happen a lot?

👤 User: yeah like every day

🤖 Bot: Sounds like a pattern. What's the main issue for you - the extra work or the 
       timing?

👤 User: the timing. i never know if i can leave on time

🤖 Bot: That uncertainty would stress anyone out. I can't change your boss's timing, 
       but I can help you manage the stress this creates. Want to try that?

👤 User: sure

🤖 Bot: It's called the 4Rs framework. You've already done RECOGNIZE - you know this 
       pattern triggers stress. Now REGULATE - when they hand you work at 5pm, what 
       could help you stay calm?

👤 User: maybe just accept it's going to happen?

🤖 Bot: Right, expecting it instead of being surprised. Now RESPECT - why might your 
       boss do this?

👤 User: probably they're disorganized or have stuff come up last minute

🤖 Bot: Probably not personal to you. REFLECT - what boundary could you test, like 
       'I can start on this tomorrow morning'?

👤 User: i could try that

🤖 Bot: You've used the full 4Rs approach. Use it anytime you're managing difficult 
       work situations.
```

**Key Features Shown:**
- Casual Gen Z tone ("super frustrating", "cool", "what's up")
- Same frameworks, different language style
- Adapts to user's language ("i'm" lowercase, informal)
- Still professional coaching content
- Tone preference remembered across conversation

## Demo 4: Off-Topic Handling (Boundary Enforcement)

```
👤 User: can you help me with my relationship problems with my girlfriend?

🤖 Bot: I'm focused on helping with workplace situations - things like adapting to 
       change, managing work stress, or handling difficult colleagues. For personal 
       relationships outside work, I'm not the right resource. 

       Is there a workplace challenge I can help with instead?

👤 User: ok, what about stress from my commute?

🤖 Bot: Commute stress can definitely impact your work! But I'm best suited for 
       challenges that happen within the workplace environment itself. 

       If commute stress is affecting how you perform at work or interact with 
       colleagues, we could explore coping strategies for that part. Does that apply?

👤 User: yeah it makes me grumpy when i arrive

🤖 Bot: That's a workplace impact we can work with. What part feels hardest - managing 
       your mood when you arrive, or how you interact with others when stressed?
```

**Key Features Shown:**
- Polite but firm boundaries
- Redirects to workplace focus
- Finds relevant workplace angle when possible
- Professional tone even when declining
- User-friendly boundary enforcement

👤 User: [Sends voice message]
       🎤 "Hey, I'm really stressed about this presentation tomorrow. 
           My boss wants me to present to the board and I've never 
           done that before. I'm worried I'll mess up."

🤖 Bot: That's a lot of pressure. What part feels scariest - the board itself, 
       or being unprepared?

👤 User: The board. They're intimidating.

🤖 Bot: Makes sense. Let's Think about what you can control. You can't control 
       how they react, but you can control your prep. Got your key points ready?

👤 User: Yeah I think so

🤖 Bot: Good. One Engage step: practice your opening 30 seconds out loud 5 times 
       before tomorrow. Just that part. Gets you confident on the start. Try it?

👤 User: ok i'll do that tonight

🤖 Bot: Nice. After the presentation, quick Perform check: What went well? What 
       would you change? That's how you build the skill.
```

## Demo 6: Multi-Turn Conversation (Context Retention)

```
👤 User: my team doesn't respect my ideas

🤖 Bot: That's tough. What makes you think they don't respect your ideas?

👤 User: they always talk over me in meetings

🤖 Bot: When they talk over you, how do you typically respond?

👤 User: i just stop talking and give up

🤖 Bot: That's frustrating. Let's try something different. Next meeting, when 
       interrupted, say "Let me finish this point." Assertive but professional. 
       Think you could try that?

👤 User: yeah but what if they don't listen

🤖 Bot: Good question. If they still interrupt, follow up afterward one-on-one: 
       "I noticed my point got cut off earlier. Can I share it with you now?" 
       This shows you value your ideas. Worth testing?

👤 User: ok i'll try

[Next day]

👤 User: i tried what you said yesterday

🤖 Bot: Nice! How'd it go?

👤 User: it actually worked, they let me finish

🤖 Bot: That's awesome. You stood up for your ideas and they responded. Keep using 
       that - "Let me finish" is your new tool. What did you notice about how it felt?

👤 User: i felt more confident

🤖 Bot: That confidence came from you taking action. Use this same approach whenever 
       you need to be heard. You've got this.
